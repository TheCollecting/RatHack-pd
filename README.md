current status: working and enabled for public

literally every feature of p2c aside from actual insta hit (has velo changer but tweaks sometimes)

script line length: 2206

coming soon: proper silent when underground, resolver/manip, container searcher (almost done), proper player value calc (gonna be stupidly laggy so solid maybe on this), even more optimization
