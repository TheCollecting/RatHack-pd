```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheCollecting/RatHack-pd/refs/heads/main/script.lua"))()
```

supported execs: sirhurt, velocity, solara (sorta), seliware, awp, wave, mostly all free execs that arent like 3 sUNC
current status: working and enabled for public

literally every feature of most p2c keep crying

script line length: 2428

coming soon: manip, container searcher (almost done), proper player value calc (gonna be stupidly laggy so solid maybe on this)

if i get unhappy enough source will be posted, pd sucks and script devs are almost all strange
